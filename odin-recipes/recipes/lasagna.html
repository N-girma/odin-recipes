    <p><strong>Lasagna</strong> is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide flat pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. It is typically baked in the oven until the top layer is golden brown and bubbly. Lasagna is a comforting and hearty dish that is perfect for feeding a crowd or for special occasions.</p>
    <p>The traditional lasagna recipe starts with cooking the pasta sheets until al dente. The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or sausage, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs, is prepared separately. The creamy béchamel sauce, made with butter, flour, milk, and nutmeg, adds a velvety texture to the dish.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3> Steps needed for making the dish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li> In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with the egg until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat this layering process two more times, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and cheese on top.</li>
        <li> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li> Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
