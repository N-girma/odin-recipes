    <p>Mac and cheese, short for macaroni and cheese, is a popular and comforting dish that features cooked macaroni pasta coated in a creamy cheese sauce. It is a classic comfort food that is loved by both kids and adults for its rich and indulgent flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz (about 2 cups) of elbow macaroni or any pasta shape of your choice</li>
        <li>4 tbsp of butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 2 1/2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese or a combination of cheeses (such as cheddar, mozzarella, or Gruyere)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li> Optional seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, or paprika for added flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> steps needed for making the dish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the cheese sauce: In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour to create a roux. Cook the roux for a couple of minutes until it turns a light golden color.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens and comes to a simmer.</li>
        <li> Add the shredded cheese to the sauce, reserving some for topping if desired. Stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings you like.</li>
        <li> Combine the pasta and cheese sauce: Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li> Bake (optional): If you want to bake your macaroni and cheese, transfer the mixture to a baking dish. Top with any reserved cheese, bread crumbs, or Parmesan cheese for added crunch.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve hot: Let the macaroni and cheese cool slightly before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh herbs if desired.</li>
